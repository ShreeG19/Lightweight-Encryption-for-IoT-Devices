# Lightweight Encryption for IoT Devices (Arduino-Based)

This project implements lightweight encryption suitable for IoT devices using Arduino. It focuses on secure data handling in low-resource environments like sensors and embedded systems.

## Platform

- Arduino (tested on ESP32 / ATmega board)
- Analog sensors (e.g., LM35)
- Encrypted data transmission (simulated)

## What’s Included

- `Report.pdf` – Full theoretical explanation (4–5 pages)
- `circuit_diagram.jpg` – Hardware setup image
- `README.md` – Project description

## Note

Due to hardware limitations and embedded constraints, the Arduino `.ino` file is not uploaded. This repository serves as a **theoretical and documentation showcase** only.

## Report Covers

- Lightweight encryption need in IoT
- Constraints in embedded systems
- Algorithm logic used in Arduino
- Real-world use cases
